# ⏳ Forecasting Time Series with Python 📈

Welcome to the **Forecasting-Time-Series-with-Python** repository! This project demonstrates how to analyze, model, and forecast time series data using both traditional statistical methods (ARIMA/SARIMA) and deep learning models (LSTM). 🔍🧠

---

## 📖 Overview

This project showcases two approaches to time series forecasting:
- **Classical models** like ARIMA and SARIMA for interpretable forecasting.
- **Deep learning models** like LSTM for capturing complex temporal patterns.

It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual)
- 📉 ARIMA/SARIMA model fitting and prediction
- 🤖 LSTM-based deep learning forecasting
- 📈 Visualization of actual vs predicted results
- 📦 Clean and modular notebook structure

---

## 📊 Models Used

- **ARIMA/SARIMA** – Statsmodels implementation for seasonal and non-seasonal time series.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** – TensorFlow/Keras-based neural network for sequential forecasting.

## ▶️ How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project successfully:

1. **📁 Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Forecasting-Time-Series-with-Python.git
   cd Forecasting-Time-Series-with-Python
   ```

2. **💾 Add required files:**
   - Place your `.csv` time series dataset into the `data/` folder.  
     Example: `data/stock_prices.csv`, `data/sales_data.csv`
   - (Optional) Add any `.txt` config files, such as parameter configs or notes, if used in the notebook.

3. **🧪 Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open either:
   - `notebooks/Time Series Analysis.ipynb` — for ARIMA/SARIMA model
   - `notebooks/Time-series data analysis using LSTM.ipynb` — for LSTM deep learning

4. **⚙️ Execute the notebook cells one-by-one:**
   - Load the dataset from `.csv` file
   - Visualize trends and perform decomposition
   - Train forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)
   - Evaluate and visualize predicted results

5. ✅ **Done!** You should see visual graphs comparing actual vs predicted data.

> ⚠️ Make sure the dataset format matches what’s expected by the notebooks (e.g., a `Date` column and a `Value` column).
